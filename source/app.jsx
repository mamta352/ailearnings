            <p className="text-gray-400 text-sm leading-relaxed">The AI Engineering Roadmap is a structured, opinionated learning path that takes software developers from zero AI knowledge to shipping production AI applications. It covers 7 phases: AI Foundations, LLM Setup & APIs, Prompt Engineering, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Agentic AI, Fine-tuning LLMs, and deploying real projects.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-400 text-sm leading-relaxed">Unlike generic "learn AI" lists, this roadmap is designed for developers — it prioritizes building over reading, practical tools over theory, and real projects over certificates. Every phase ends with a concrete project milestone so you always know when you've truly learned something.</p>
