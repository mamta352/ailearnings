# Supervised Learning Guide: Algorithms, Workflows, and Best Practices

Supervised learning is responsible for the vast majority of ML in production today — fraud detection, churn prediction, medical diagnosis, content ranking, price estimation. You give it labeled examples and it learns to generalize. That sounds simple, but doing it well requires understanding which algorithm fits which problem, which metrics actually measure what you care about, and how to avoid the subtle traps that make models fail in production while looking good in development. This guide covers all of it.

## Regression vs Classification: Picking the Right Problem Formulation

The first decision in any supervised learning project is not which algorithm to use — it is what you are predicting.

**Regression** predicts a continuous numeric output:
- House price ($342,500)
- Sales revenue next quarter ($2.1M)
- Temperature tomorrow (24°C)
- Probability of churn (0.73)

**Classification** predicts a discrete category:
- Spam detection (spam / not spam)
- Disease diagnosis (positive / negative)
- Image recognition (cat / dog / bird / car)
- Loan approval (approve / deny)

The difference is in your target variable: continuous → regression, categorical → classification. A common source of confusion is probability outputs — predicting a probability (0–1) is regression, even though it often feeds into a binary decision downstream.

## Core Algorithms

### Linear Regression

Fits a line (or hyperplane) through data by minimizing the sum of squared errors. It is the simplest regression model and the most interpretable — each coefficient tells you exactly how much the output changes per unit change in that feature.

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.datasets import load_diabetes
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score
import numpy as np

X, y = load_diabetes(return_X_y=True)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
print(f"RMSE: {np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)):.2f}")
print(f"R²:   {r2_score(y_test, y_pred):.3f}")

# Examine coefficients
for feature, coef in zip(range(X.shape[1]), model.coef_):
    print(f"  Feature {feature}: {coef:.4f}")
```

**Use when:** the relationship is approximately linear, you need interpretability, or you are establishing a baseline.

### Logistic Regression

Despite the name, this is a classification algorithm. It estimates the probability that an instance belongs to a class using the logistic (sigmoid) function, then applies a threshold (usually 0.5) to make a binary prediction.

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, roc_auc_score
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline

X, y = load_breast_cancer(return_X_y=True)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Always scale features for logistic regression
pipeline = Pipeline([
    ('scaler', StandardScaler()),
    ('model', LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000, C=1.0)),
])
pipeline.fit(X_train, y_train)

print(classification_report(y_test, pipeline.predict(X_test)))
print(f"AUC-ROC: {roc_auc_score(y_test, pipeline.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1]):.3f}")
```

**Use when:** you need a fast, interpretable baseline, probability calibration matters (e.g., risk scoring), or you want to understand feature contributions directly.

### Decision Trees

Learns a sequence of if/else rules by finding the feature splits that best separate classes at each node. Extremely interpretable — you can print the entire decision path for any prediction.

```python
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier, export_text
from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer

X, y = load_breast_cancer(return_X_y=True)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# max_depth limits tree complexity and controls overfitting
model = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=4, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Print the learned rules
feature_names = load_breast_cancer().feature_names
print(export_text(model, feature_names=list(feature_names)))
print(f"Test Accuracy: {model.score(X_test, y_test):.3f}")
```

Decision trees overfit easily without depth limits. The rules they learn are unstable — small data changes can produce very different trees. Use Random Forest or gradient boosting instead when you need reliable performance.

**Use when:** you need explainability, stakeholders need to understand the model's logic, or you are generating human-readable rules.

### Random Forest

An ensemble of decision trees trained on random data subsets with random feature subsets. The ensemble averages out individual tree errors, dramatically reducing overfitting compared to a single tree.

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
import pandas as pd

model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=200, max_depth=None, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

print(f"Test Accuracy: {model.score(X_test, y_test):.3f}")

# Feature importance — tells you which features matter most
importances = pd.Series(
    model.feature_importances_,
    index=load_breast_cancer().feature_names
)
print("\nTop 5 Features:")
print(importances.sort_values(ascending=False).head(5))
```

**Use when:** you need a reliable, strong baseline without extensive tuning, or you need feature importance estimates for feature selection.

### Gradient Boosting (XGBoost / LightGBM)

Builds trees sequentially where each tree corrects the errors of the previous ones. This is the state-of-the-art for tabular data — it wins the majority of Kaggle competitions involving structured data.

```bash
pip install xgboost
```

```python
import xgboost as xgb
from sklearn.metrics import f1_score

model = xgb.XGBClassifier(
    n_estimators=300,
    learning_rate=0.05,
    max_depth=6,
    subsample=0.8,
    colsample_bytree=0.8,
    random_state=42,
    eval_metric='logloss'
)
model.fit(
    X_train, y_train,
    eval_set=[(X_test, y_test)],
    verbose=False
)

print(f"Accuracy: {model.score(X_test, y_test):.3f}")
print(f"F1:       {f1_score(y_test, model.predict(X_test)):.3f}")
```

**Use when:** you want maximum performance on tabular/structured data and can afford slightly more tuning time than Random Forest.

## Evaluation Metrics

Using the wrong metric is one of the most common ways to ship a useless model with high reported performance.

### Regression Metrics

| Metric | Formula | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| MAE | mean(\|y - ŷ\|) | Robust to outliers; same units as target |
| RMSE | sqrt(mean((y - ŷ)²)) | Penalizes large errors more than MAE |
| R² | 1 - SS_res/SS_tot | 1.0 = perfect, 0.0 = predicts the mean |

Use RMSE when large errors are particularly costly. Use MAE when you want a metric that is easy to explain to non-technical stakeholders.

### Classification Metrics

| Metric | When to Use |
|--------|-------------|
| Accuracy | Only when classes are balanced |
| Precision | When false positives are costly (spam filters — better to miss spam than flag legitimate email) |
| Recall | When false negatives are costly (cancer screening — better to over-diagnose than miss a case) |
| F1 Score | When you need to balance precision and recall; standard for imbalanced classes |
| AUC-ROC | When you need to evaluate ranking quality or compare models regardless of threshold |

```python
from sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score, f1_score, precision_score, recall_score

y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
y_proba = model.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1]

print(f"Precision: {precision_score(y_test, y_pred):.3f}")
print(f"Recall:    {recall_score(y_test, y_pred):.3f}")
print(f"F1:        {f1_score(y_test, y_pred):.3f}")
print(f"AUC-ROC:   {roc_auc_score(y_test, y_proba):.3f}")
```

**Decision rule:** Never report only accuracy for classification. If your test set is imbalanced (most real-world datasets are), report F1 and AUC-ROC.

---

## Cross-Validation

A single train/test split is an unstable estimate of model performance — it depends heavily on which random samples ended up in each split. Cross-validation averages over multiple splits for a reliable estimate.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score, StratifiedKFold

# StratifiedKFold preserves class proportions in each fold
# Always use it for classification
cv = StratifiedKFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=42)

scores = cross_val_score(
    RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42),
    X, y,
    cv=cv,
    scoring='f1'
)

print(f"F1: {scores.mean():.3f} ± {scores.std():.3f}")
```

The standard deviation is as important as the mean. A model with F1 = 0.85 ± 0.02 is more reliable than one with F1 = 0.87 ± 0.12. High variance signals overfitting or insufficient data.

---

## Hyperparameter Tuning

### Grid Search

Exhaustive search over a specified parameter grid. Guaranteed to find the best combination within the grid, but slow for large grids.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

param_grid = {
    'n_estimators': [100, 200, 300],
    'max_depth': [3, 5, 7, None],
    'min_samples_split': [2, 5, 10],
}

grid_search = GridSearchCV(
    RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42),
    param_grid,
    cv=5,
    scoring='f1',
    n_jobs=-1,        # use all CPU cores
    verbose=1
)
grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)

print(f"Best params: {grid_search.best_params_}")
print(f"Best F1:     {grid_search.best_score_:.3f}")
```

### Random Search

Samples random combinations — often finds equally good parameters with 10–20% of the compute cost of grid search. Use this first for large hyperparameter spaces.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import RandomizedSearchCV
from scipy.stats import randint

param_dist = {
    'n_estimators': randint(100, 500),
    'max_depth': [3, 5, 7, 10, None],
    'min_samples_split': randint(2, 20),
    'min_samples_leaf': randint(1, 10),
}

random_search = RandomizedSearchCV(
    RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42),
    param_dist,
    n_iter=50,
    cv=5,
    scoring='f1',
    n_jobs=-1,
    random_state=42
)
random_search.fit(X_train, y_train)
print(f"Best F1: {random_search.best_score_:.3f}")
```

---

## Feature Preprocessing

Most algorithms require features to be on a similar scale. Tree-based models (decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting) are an exception — they split on individual feature values and are scale-invariant.

For linear models, SVMs, and neural networks: always scale your features.

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Correct: fit scaler on train data only, transform both train and test
pipeline = Pipeline([
    ('scaler', StandardScaler()),         # zero mean, unit variance
    ('model', LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000)),
])

pipeline.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = pipeline.predict(X_test)
```

Using a `Pipeline` is the right way to handle preprocessing — it prevents the common mistake of fitting the scaler on all data (including the test set), which constitutes data leakage.

---

## Common Pitfalls

**Using accuracy on imbalanced data** — A model that predicts the majority class always has high accuracy on an imbalanced dataset. Check class distribution with `y.value_counts()` before choosing your metric.

**Fitting preprocessing on the full dataset** — Fitting a `StandardScaler` or `SimpleImputer` on train + test data leaks information from the test set into training. Always use a `Pipeline` to prevent this.

**Temporal leakage** — For time-series or sequential data, never randomly split. Use a time-based split where the test set contains only future data. Training on future data to predict the past is leakage.

**Ignoring feature correlations in importance** — Random Forest feature importance splits importance among correlated features. Two perfectly correlated features each get half the importance they deserve. Use permutation importance for a more reliable signal.

**Over-tuning on validation data** — If you run 100 hyperparameter experiments and pick the best result, you have overfit to your validation set. Report final performance on a held-out test set that was never used for selection.

## Key Takeaways

- Supervised learning maps labeled input-output pairs to a prediction function — the algorithm matters far less than data quality, clean labels, and correct problem formulation
- For tabular data in 2026, gradient boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM) is the default algorithm — it consistently outperforms neural networks on structured data with under 1M rows
- Accuracy is a misleading metric for imbalanced datasets — a fraud detector predicting "not fraud" for every transaction achieves 99.9% accuracy and detects nothing; use F1 or AUC-ROC instead
- Cross-validation is not optional — a single train/test split gives one performance estimate that heavily depends on which samples ended up in the test set; CV averages over multiple splits for reliability
- Data leakage is the silent accuracy thief — fitting scalers, imputers, or encoders on the full dataset before splitting guarantees inflated estimates that collapse in production; always use a Pipeline
- Temporal data requires time-based splits — random shuffling of time-series data allows future information to appear in training, producing unrealistically optimistic results
- Feature importance from random forests distributes importance among correlated features — two perfectly correlated features each get half the importance they deserve; use permutation importance for reliable signals
- Hyperparameter tuning on validation data accumulates overfitting to validation — report final performance on a held-out test set that was never used for any selection decision

## FAQ

**What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?**
Supervised learning trains on labeled data where each example has a known output (class label or numeric value). Unsupervised learning finds structure in unlabeled data — clustering groups similar examples together, dimensionality reduction compresses high-dimensional data into fewer dimensions. In practice, most production ML uses supervised learning because labeled data provides a clear training signal and measurable performance targets.

**Which algorithm should I start with for a new classification problem?**
Start with logistic regression as a baseline — it is fast, interpretable, and often surprisingly competitive. Then try random forest or gradient boosting (XGBoost). If gradient boosting does not improve meaningfully over logistic regression, the bottleneck is data quality, not algorithm choice. Only consider neural networks for tabular classification if you have more than 100,000 rows and gradient boosting has been tuned properly.

**How do I choose the right metric for my problem?**
Match the metric to the business cost of errors. If false positives and false negatives have equal cost, use F1. If missing a positive (false negative) is much worse — like in medical screening — optimize recall. If false positives are more costly — like spam filters — optimize precision. For overall classifier quality across all thresholds, use AUC-ROC.

**How much data do I need for supervised learning?**
It depends on the complexity of the pattern and the number of features. A rough heuristic: 10–50 labeled examples per feature for simple linear problems; thousands of examples per class for complex non-linear patterns. Gradient boosting generalizes well with a few thousand rows. Neural networks typically need 100,000+ to outperform gradient boosting on tabular data.

**What is class imbalance and how do I handle it?**
Class imbalance occurs when one class is much more common than another — typical in fraud detection, churn, and medical diagnosis. Strategies: oversample the minority class (SMOTE), undersample the majority class, or use class weights in the loss function. Most scikit-learn estimators accept `class_weight="balanced"` to automatically weight classes inversely to their frequency.

**What is the difference between validation set and test set?**
The validation set is used during development for model selection and hyperparameter tuning — you can look at it repeatedly. The test set is a final held-out set used once, at the very end, to report final performance. If you tune hyperparameters based on test set performance, your reported numbers are optimistically biased. The test set simulates unseen production data.

**Why does my model perform well in cross-validation but fail in production?**
Distribution shift: your training data does not match production data. Common causes — seasonal patterns in time-series data, demographic differences between train and prod users, data pipeline changes that alter feature distributions. Monitor feature distributions in production (data drift) and retrain when drift is detected.
